# Real_Time_Automatic_Number_Plate_Recognition
In this project, I leverage Python Tensorflow Object Detection to be able to detect license plates using Kaggle Data. Once those plates have been
detected I was then be able to apply OCR to extract the text from each and every plate using PyTorch and EasyOCR.
On top of it all, I was be able to export my results. I also setup a saving function to output the regions of interest as well as the detected text. This
could be used as part of a broader system or standalone.
